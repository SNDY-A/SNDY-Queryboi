# SNDY-Queryboi
a lightweight, animated, and conversational UI layer for SQL databases — turning complex queries into natural conversations. Whether you're a data nerd or just someone who wants to talk to their tables, this tool helps you create, read, update, delete, and explore data without writing a single line of SQL.
It’s like texting your database,
“Create a table with Name, Email, Age” — boom, done.
“Show me all users over 25” — boom, done.
“Drop the ‘test_users’ table” — wait wait, it’ll ask if you're sure 😉

What It Does:
- 🧠 Converts natural language prompts into valid SQL queries  
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface to run, edit, and view query results  
- 🛡️ Built-in validation to prevent risky operations or syntax errors  
- 🗂️ Easy database connection (SQLite for now — more soon)  
- 🧩 Lean, fast, and beginner-friendly — no need to know SQL
Example: What if managing databases felt like chatting with a smart assistant instead of wrestling with SQL syntax? Instead of writing verbose code;
users would just say things like:
"Create a table called employees with columns: id, name, role"
"Insert Sandy as Developer in row 2"
"Update salary of Sandy to 1 Million"
"Show me all entries where salary > 80k"
"Drop the archive table but show me a warning first"
